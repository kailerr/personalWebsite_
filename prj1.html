    <p>The image above is a wind turbine that I helped create in ENGR10. Although it may look simple
        , the turbine can generate quite a bit of energy. The goal was to follow the diagram above,
         which was to produced the required amount of energy with a motorized blade. Our restrictions
         were a 17 inch tower with a base of 11.75 x 11.75. Our group was tasked to calculate each blade's axis and angle
        to maximize energy production. Also, we had to reach a stiffness quota,
        which was the measurement of our tower's stability. The blade was carefully created using Autodesk and other
        3D printing features. Below this paragraph displays the results of our efforts, which include our
        windmill's power measurements in RPM(Rotations Per Minute) and Amps. In my opinion, the most significant part of this project
        was Autodesk since it showed me many different strengths and aspects of mechanical engineering.
