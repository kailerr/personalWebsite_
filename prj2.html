        The video and image above show the robot that was built in ENGR10.
        This project was divided into 3 groups, coding, soldering, and hardware. 
        Our objective was to create a robot that detected a green beacon, picked it up, then 
        capturing a red beacon. After completeing all these task, the robot had to return out of the arena.
        Personally, I was placed in the coding group where we utilized C to operate the robot.
        We were tasked to code the robot's wheel rotations, arm movements, and its autonomous
        detection system. This project was eye-opening since I was able to envision the potential
        of technology, cooperation and coding.
